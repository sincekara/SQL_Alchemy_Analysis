## Step 2 - Climate App

Now that you have completed your initial analysis, design a 
Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.

* Use FLASK to create your routes.

### Routes

* `/`

  * Home page.

  * List all routes that are available.

* `/api/v1.0/precipitation`

  * Convert the query results to a Dictionary using 
    `date` as the key and `prcp` as the value.

  * Return the JSON representation of your dictionary.

* `/api/v1.0/stations`

  * Return a JSON list of stations from the dataset.

* `/api/v1.0/tobs`
  * query for the dates and temperature observations from 
    a year from the last data point.
  * Return a JSON list of Temperature Observations (tobs) for the 
    previous year.

* `/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`

  * Return a JSON list of the minimum temperature, the average 
    temperature, and the max temperature for a given start or start-end range.

  * When given the start only, calculate `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for 
    all dates greater than and equal to the start date.

  * When given the start and the end date, calculate the `TMIN`, 
    `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for dates between the start and end date inclusive.

## Hints

* You will need to join the station and measurement tables for some of 
  the analysis queries.

* Use Flask `jsonify` to convert your API data into a valid JSON response 
  object.
